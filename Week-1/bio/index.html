        <p>       Every life has a story, here's my work life history in 30 seconds or less. I am a Web Developer.
                  I’m looking for opportunities as a full stack developer position.

                  Web development programming and over a decade of managerial experience.

                  some consulting firms as web developer. I’ve developed applications using many programming languages to name a
                  few I have used Visual Basic, PHP, ASP, SQL and My SQL as a backend and used JavaScript, CSS and HTML for
                  User Interference. I’m very familiar with full cycle aspect of programming.
                  On many of my positions as a software developer I was responsible for maintenance,
                  support as well as communicating with the client on weekly bases. </p>
