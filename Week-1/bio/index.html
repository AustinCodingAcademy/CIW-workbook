      <p>I was born in Guanajuato, Mexico and lived in Dallas from five until I turned ten,
        then I moved back to Mexico, came back five years later and been here since then, now
        I only travel for weeks and not years. <br/>I am now pursuing a career in development.
        In the effort to do so, I am completing core classes at DCCCD with hopes to transfer
        over to the University of Texas in Dallas to complete my major in Software Engineering.
        In addition to DCCCD, I am also the Dallas Coding Academy, and I will obtain a
        certification in .Net programming. I obtained two degrees, Network System Administration
        and Software Development from ITT Tech, but we all know what that is worth.
        <br/>I currently work for National Math and Science Initiative, a non-profit dedicated to
        improving STEM education in the US; my role is Desktop Support with a plan to move to a
        software development position by the end of the year. My Goal is to become a Senior
        Software Engineer and eventually a Director of Software Development while discovering
        and developing the best new app. <br/>In addition to coding I also love outdoor activities
        with my son and playing soccer, I am trying to keep him away from video games and TV.
