      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>On the sweltering evening of August 1, in the year of our Lord 1975,
        I was born to little fan-fair, in the small town of Ada, OK. From there, I lead a somewhat normal
        life in rural Oklahoma. While growing up, I attended the Atoka school system.  It was a very simple
        life.</P>
        <p>Upon graduating high school, I attended several colleges, due to my unhealthy addiction to
          education.  An addiction that has cost more than it is worth.  Along with that addiction, I discovered
          that I had developed an attraction to taking extreme risks.  It was then that I became convinced that I
          was not long for this world.</p>

            <h2>Middle Life</h2>
            <p>With the idea of having a short life-span being an ever-present thought, I decided that
              I should cram every experience I ever wanted into my life, as quickly as possible.  I was a
              bartender, a CIO and Administrator of a healthcare corporation, a musician, and eventually a husband and father.
              Note to the reader:  Don't wait until your 40's to have kids.  Trust me on this.</p>
              <p>Living past 25, 30, 35, 40, and beyond, I have become convinced of some new ideas.  One, I'm lucky to have
                survived the musician years.  Two, I should be more careful, I've got a kid to look after, now.  And three,
                it's never too late to grow up.
