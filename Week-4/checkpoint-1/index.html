        In Contrast, customers using our virtual teams have had less than 5% turnover over the last 15 years. We locate our development teams in medium sized metros where talent is stable instead of the IT mecas. So our customers’ institutional knowledge stays with the team and you benefit from a deep knowledge base year over year.
</p><p><p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
We work hard to hire great people and keep them. We strive to build a winning culture of accountability and communication. We also cross-train our team as we work on technology so that if someone’s out you can can have confidence that your project is still being worked on and it completed on time.</span>
