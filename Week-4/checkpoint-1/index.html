      <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
        equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
         Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
         Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted
         among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,
          — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these
          ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to
           institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles
           and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most
            likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.</p>
